- Email format validation using regex
- Minimum message length (10 characters)
- Field-level error messages
- Inline feedback as user corrects errors
- Submit button loading state

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading consideration for images
- Efficient CSS Grid layouts
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- Intersection Observer for scroll animations
- Optimized font loading with preconnect

### 6. User Experience
- Responsive design across devices
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Animation effects on section reveal

## Performance Metrics

- Lighthouse recommendations followed for:
  - Core Web Vitals optimization
  - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Best practices
  
See Lighthouse report notes in technical documentation.

---

## Code Quality

- Clean, readable code with consistent formatting
- Meaningful comments on complex sections
- Proper indentation and structure
- No console errors or broken links
- Semantic HTML for accessibility

---

## Known Limitations

- GitHub API unauthenticated requests have rate limits (60/hour)
- Private repositories cannot be displayed (public only)
- Large repository lists may take a moment to load

---

## Future Improvements
