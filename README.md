## Setup — Run Locally

1. **Clone or download** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ID-YOUR_NAME-assignment2.git
   cd assignment-2
   ```

2. **Open in browser** — no build step needed:
   ```bash
   # Option A — just double-click index.html
   open index.html

   # Option B — use VS Code Live Server extension
   # Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"

   # Option C — Python simple server
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   # Then visit http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. **File paths**: CSS is at `css/styles.css` and JS at `js/script.js` — make sure these folders exist relative to `index.html`.

## AI Usage Summary

Claude (claude.ai) was used to assist with:
- Generating the initial enhanced code structure as a starting point
- Suggesting the public API integration pattern (uselessfacts API + local fallback)
- Reviewing accessibility attributes (aria-expanded, role="tab", aria-selected)

All AI-generated code was reviewed, understood, and customized. See **`docs/ai-usage-report.md`** for full details.
